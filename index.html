    <main> 
        <section id="coloronly">
            <p>Let's explore the basics of CSS and the Box Model.</p>
            <p>The main section will have a dashed border with a different background colour different from the header</p>
            <p>This particular section in the main has it's own style id with only colour changed.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="border">
            <p>CSS styles HTML. The Box Model treats each element as a box.</p>
            <p>This is another section but this time I have added a style id with red border and the color changed</p>
        </section>

        <section id="padding">
            <p>Now we will apply padding to this section.</p>
            <p>Notice how it adds space inside the border and around the content.</p>
            <p>Observe that the borders are still joined together after adjusting the padding</p>
        </section>

        <section id="margin">
            <p>Now we will apply margin to this section.</p>
            <p>Notice how it shifts the box and the content to the right and down.</p>
            <p>Observe that the borders are not joined together after adjusting the margin</p>
        </section>


    <section id="summary">
